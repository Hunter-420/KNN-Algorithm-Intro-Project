In this mini project,
We learn about KNN algorithm & solve a simple problem

We have a dataset of social network ads & the our task is:

->Data Pre-processing step

->Fitting the K-NN algorithm to the Training set

->Predicting the test result

->Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)

->Visualizing the test set result.

->Predict for scoring query
